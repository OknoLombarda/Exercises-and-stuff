# BookManager
This program is made for personal usage only. I'm going to make a program that allows to read books of Skyrim
outside of the game so I needed an utility to shortlist books I'll add to the program and here it is

Functionality:
* Display next txt file in the list
* Delete current txt file
* Save current position in the list of files for further work
* Change particular substring in all txt files in the list
* Backup all files in the list
* Load files from backup
